## Business Problem Statement

Our company is seeking to optimize its strategic initiatives and marketing efforts by leveraging detailed sales and customer data from our SQL database. To achieve this, we need to address several key business questions that will help us understand employee hierarchy, customer spending patterns, genre popularity, and regional market dynamics. Specifically, we are focused on:

### 1. Employee Hierarchy Analysis
- Identify the most senior employee within our organization based on job title to ensure proper recognition and alignment of senior management roles.

### 2. Invoice and Revenue Analysis
- Determine which countries generate the highest number of invoices and identify the city with the highest total revenue. This will guide our decisions on where to allocate resources for promotional events, such as a Music Festival, to maximize impact and return on investment.

### 3. Customer Spending Insights
- Identify the top customer who has spent the most on our products to tailor personalized marketing strategies and recognize high-value customers.

### 4. Music Genre Popularity
- Analyze the genre preferences of our customers, particularly focusing on Rock music, to tailor our inventory and marketing strategies to align with customer interests.

### 5. Artist Revenue Impact
- Discover which artists have generated the most revenue and identify the top customers who have spent the most on these artists, aiding in strategic partnerships and targeted promotions.

### 6. Genre Popularity by Country
- Understand the most popular music genres in each country based on purchase data to customize regional marketing efforts and stock the most popular genres in different regions.

### 7. Top Spending Customers by Country
- Identify the top-spending customers in each country to enhance regional marketing strategies and customer relationship management.

By addressing these questions, we aim to make data-driven decisions that will enhance our marketing strategies, optimize resource allocation, and ultimately drive revenue growth.
